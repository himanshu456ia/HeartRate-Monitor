This Arduino project is designed to measure and display heartbeats per minute using a heart rate sensor and an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).
The system is initiated by pressing a button, after which it counts the number of heartbeats over a 10-second interval.
The heart rate is then calculated and displayed on the LCD.
The project utilizes a timer to keep track of the time, and the LCD provides real-time updates on the current heartbeat count, time elapsed, and calculated heartbeats per minute.
